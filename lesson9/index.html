            <h3>June snow blankets parts of Idaho, Montana; sheriff issues warrant for Mother Nature over 'illegal
                dumping'</h3>

            <p>After the latest round of snow in parts of the Rockies just days before the summer solstice, Mother
                Nature is in some hot water with local authorities.</p>

                <p>Snow hit parts of the region as a storm system and very cold air moved through Tuesday into
                Wednesday.</p>

                <p> Idaho's Blaine County, the sheriff's office said on Facebook that deputies were dealing with
                stuck vehicles in the state's high country after 10 inches of snow were reported north of Galena
                Summit.</p>

                <p>The sheriff's office also had blunt words over the frosty conditions, joking that a felony warrant
                had been issued for Mother Nature for "illegal dumping."</p>

                <p>"If you see her please show her a calendar. She thinks it's Junuary (January)," the sheriff's office
                said.</p>

                <p>Around 6 inches of snow was reported south of Galena Summit as the storm system moved through.</p>

                <p>Photos released by the sheriff's office showed some vehicles stuck on roadways and trying to
                navigate high-elevation passes.</p>

                <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) office in Boise showed images from Bogus Basin and Redfish Lake
                as snow coated the area.</p>

                <p>In neighboring Montana, forecasters at the NWS office in Missoula said that snow levels remained
                above 6,000 feet, but accumulating snowfall stayed out of populated valleys.</p>

                <p>Mountain passes across southwest Montana and central Idaho, however, saw several inches of heavy,
                wet snow.</p>

                <p>Winter weather conditions caused the Beartooth Pass on U.S. Highway 212 to close between Wyoming and
                Montana for several hours as the heavy snow fell, according to the Billings Gazette.</p>

                <p>Lower elevations just saw rain and patchy fog.</p>

                <p>The snow came a little more than a week after another storm dropped up to a foot of snow in the same
                high-elevation spots of the region.</p>

                <p>Forecasters said the system behind the blast of winter is moving east, and will threaten the
                northern Plains and Upper Midwest over the rest of the week.
